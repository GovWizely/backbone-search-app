            "description": "Join us for a webinar on business opportunities in Chile. Chile is stable, prosperous, and consistently ranks high on international indices relating to economic freedom, transparency, and competitiveness. Chile continues to be a strong trading partner and export market for U.S. companies, largely due to its open market policies, zero tariffs, stable democratic government, solid business practices, and low corruption. While GDP growth over the last 30 years has averaged 5% per year, the Chilean economy has slowed recently, with just 1.9% growth in 2014 and projected GDP growth of less than 2.0% in 2015. As the United States - Chile Free Trade Agreement (FTA) concludes its eleventh year, trade of products and services continues to be a resounding success, with an increase of over 330% in bilateral trade since implementation. As of January 2015, the FTA is complete and all U.S.-origin products now enter Chile tariff free.",
